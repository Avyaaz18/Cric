## Profile

The left-arm-pace bowling of Obed McCoy is tailor-made for the T20 format. He has lot of variations up his sleeves and that makes him a difficult bowler to score off, specially in the death overs. McCoy's talent was taken seriously by the Windies officials and he was a part of the Under-19 WC squad in 2016.

He finished Global T-20 as the highest wicket taker for West Indies B in 2018 and was handed a CPL contract by St. Lucia Stars. McCoy played an imperative role in breaking the 14-match losing streak of Stars against Tridents. Stars were dismal in the 2018 season but McCoy emerged as one of the better performers from their team. This also resulted in him getting his maiden ODI cap in 2018. He played a couple of ODIs against the visiting Indian side.

However his promise as a bowler in T20s was more. He was picked up by Multan Sultans in PSL 2021. And was part of Windies WC squad for the 2021 edition. His T20 stocks got better by the day and he picked up a 6-fer against India at Warner Park to add to his growing reputation.
