## Profile

Zaheer Khan was, without a doubt, one of the greatest assets of Indian cricket. A country starved of fast-bowling talent, could not have stumbled upon a greater gift at the turn of the century when Javagal Srinath, India's spearhead at the time, was into his thirties and in the twilight of his career. Zaheer ended up as one of the greatest new-ball bowlers of all time (particularly to left-handers), an expert at the art of reverse-swing (even with the old white ball), a potent bowler in the Test arena, and finally, a World Cup hero.

Zaheer's tendency to break down with injury remained a problem until the very end, and hampered the coherence of a potentially better career. Nevertheless, given his ability to bowl a wide variety of slower deliveries, conventional and reverse-swing, seam, and the ability to adjust his skills to all three brands of ball (Dukes, Kookaburra and SG), Zaheer was a landmark in adaptability. With an astute cricketing mind, and ability to match, he had the perfect blend of brawns and brain. Zaheer Khan was certainly one of the most complete pacers of his era - not something you expect to hear about an Indian fast bowler.

Nevertheless, shielded behind this facade of glory, was a story of struggle.
