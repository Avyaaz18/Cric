## Profile

When all is well with Yuvraj Singh, he hits the ball as clean and long as it has ever been hit. When all is not well, he looks so awkward you forget he can hit the ball clean and long. All has been well with Yuvraj more often in limited-overs cricket, where he can be effortless and brutal at the same time, than in Tests, though his form and consistency has been on the decline since his comeback following a recovery from a rare form of germ cell cancer in 2012. When he started off, though, his athleticism on the field and his canny left-arm spin made him a key one-day player as Indian cricket went through a makeover at the turn of the century.

At 18 he was shredding a strong Australian attack, in only his second ODI, in the Champions Trophy in 2000. His ODI career is full of highlight reels, with the biggest impact being his contribution to India's World Cup triumph in 2011 - 362 runs, 15 wickets, and four Man-of-the-Match awards, and the Player of the Tournament. That put to shade even his awesome achievement in the World T20 triumph in 2007, where he famously hit a Stuart Broad over for six sixes.

However, his limitations have manifested themselves in Tests, where he has struggled both against the seaming and swinging ball, and quality spin. Apart from three shining innings - a sparkling century on a Lahore greentop, another from 61 for 4 against Pakistan, and an unbeaten 85 in a successful chase of 387 in Chennai - his Test career doesn't have much to write home about.

The World Cup win in 2011 was the biggest moment of his cricket career, but soon after that came the biggest challenge of his life, when he was diagnosed cancer which required a two-and-a-half month treatment in the USA. He returned home after completing his chemotherapy in April 2012, fairly confident that he could resume his duties on the cricket field reasonably quickly and in August he was named in India's squad for the World T20 in Sri Lanka.

Despite all his success in white-ball cricket, Yuvraj was never able to make an impression in Tests. The case is quite similar to Australian great Michael Bevan who endured a fine career in ODIs but struggled in the longest format. Yuvraj also wasn't able to get a grip of red-ball cricket although he did produce a few fine knocks. In domestic cricket, he had played several marathon knocks but wasn't able to replicate that form or consistency at the highest level. Irrespective of what the future holds for him, Yuvraj shall be remembered as one of India's finest limited-overs greats.

Yuvraj Singh announced his decision to retire from all forms of international cricket on June 10, 2019.
