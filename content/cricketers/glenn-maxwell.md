## Profile

One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the limited-overs formats. His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click.

To date, his most extraordinary display (among many) came against Afghanistan in the 2023 ODI World Cup when he struck a monumental 201 not out off 128 balls lead Australia to a remarkable victory from an almost hopeless position.

Australia have also used Maxwell in Tests but to less effect. However, in Delhi in 2013 he had the distinction of opening the batting and bowling in the same Test, as Australia strove in vain to turn their disastrous series around. He came close to a recall on the 2022 tour of Sri Lanka.

In late 2022 he suffered a badly broken leg when he slipped at a friend's birthday party.
