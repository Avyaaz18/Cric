## Profile

By the time Kane Williamson is finished with playing cricket, it is probable that he will be New Zealand's greatest batsman. Even Martin Crowe endorsed that view. But he may also finish as one of the game's most loved global figures. Williamson is ambidextrous, bats right-handed in the top order across formats, and has become a pillar of the New Zealand side since he made his debut in 2010.

He was modest about his skills, too, - "Everyone is gifted, I guess, but you get some that seem exceptionally so. I'm not one of them," - yet Williamson was billed to make it since he was 14. He is rarely drawn to emotion and is a genial, but hard, competitor - Williamson once struck the winning six in a roller-coaster, one-wicket win over Australia in the 2015 World Cup, and celebrated with a smile and the calmest of fist pumps as Eden Park exploded in raucous jubilation.

Williamson is also an outstanding catcher and a part-time offspinner, though he needed to remodel his bowling after being banned from bowling in international cricket in June 2014 for an illegal action.

With the mental strength to match his skills, Williamson was an automatic choice to take over the captaincy at the World T20 in 2016, soon after the retirement of the inspirational Brendon McCullum. Williamson led the team to four back-to-back victories in India, and was highly praised for his tactics that helped the team adapt to slow, turning pitches, before they were beaten by England in the semi-final.

## Kane Williamson IPL factfile

- Kane Williamson became the first New Zealand player to win the orange cap in the IPL when he scored 735 runs for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in 2018. At the time, he was only the fourth overseas batter to score over 700 runs in an IPL season after Chris Gayle (twice), Michael Hussey and David Warner.

- Williamson's tally remains the fifth-highest in an IPL season behind Virat Kohli (973 in 2016), Shubman Gill (890 in 2023), Jos Buttler (863 in 2022) and Warner (848 in 2016).

- Williamson also holds the record for the third-most runs in a season as captain, behind Kohli and Warner (both 2016).

- Williamson led SRH to the final of IPL 2018 where they lost to Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Overall, he captained SRH in 46 matches, the second-highest behind Warner's 67.

- Williamson has been part of two champion squads, SRH in 2016 and Gujarat Titans (GT) in 2022, but didn't feature in the final in either of those years.
