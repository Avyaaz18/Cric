## Profile

Quinton de Kock's fearless striking and handy glovework earned him comparisons to greats of the game like Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher early in his career. By 21, he shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats for South Africa.

After a bit of a false start to his international career - he didn't do much against New Zealand and Sri Lanka in 2012 and 2013 - he scored his first ODI hundred against Pakistan later that year. Then came the three in a row against India, followed by his Test debut early in 2014.

An ankle injury threatened to put de Kock out of the 2015 World Cup, but he recovered quickly - if only to struggle through that tournament and a series against Bangladesh, after which he was dropped and spent some productive time in the A team.

In late 2021, de Kock announced a shock retirement from Tests, becoming another in a growing list of top all-format players seeking to concentrate on the white-ball formats.

## Quinton de Kock IPL factfile

- In his second season with Delhi, he scored two half-centuries in three games and finally had his breakout season in 2016. He scored 445 runs, hitting his maiden century in the tournament as well.

- After a disappointing season with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in 2018, he was snapped up by Mumbai Indians (MI).

- De Kock went past the 500-run mark both in 2019 and 2020, forming a dangerous opening partnership with Rohit Sharma to help Mumbai Indians win back-to-back titles.

- New franchise Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) bought him at the IPL 2022 mega auction and he enjoyed a stellar season, scoring 508 runs as they made it to the playoffs.

- He hammered a career-best unbeaten 140 not out off 70 against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in IPL 2022, as he and KL Rahul put on an unbroken 210 to break the record for the biggest opening partnership in the tournament's history.
