## Profile

Ricky Ponting, the most uncompromising player of his generation, grew into Australia's most successful run-maker and sits below only Bradman among the greatest batters the country has produced.

Ponting played all the shots with a full flourish of the bat - the cover drive and the pull were particularly productive for him - and knew only to attack. His breathtaking, dead-eye fielding was a force in the game by itself.

As captain, Ponting was a little less dominantly successful, but his record was magnificent all the same: 48 wins in 77 Tests gave him a win percentage second only to Steve Waugh in the game's history, despite defeats in three Ashes series and against South Africa and India. He also led Australia to 26 consecutive undefeated (completed) 50-over World Cup games, stepping down from the captaincy when that run ended, in the 2011 World Cup. For the first three years of his reign he was in charge of a superstar unit and did not have to do a whole lot tactically, but once the core of that team retired he had to change from a manager to moulder.

After his retirement, Ponting turned to coaching, with three years at the helm of Mumbai Indians in the IPL, including during their title win in 2015. In 2018, he took over as coach of the Delhi franchise.
